Personal users of Ubuntu can subscribe three machines (laptop, server or cloud) free of charge.  This service will apply critical kernel patches without rebooting. This keeps your server safe from a weakness found in the kernel,
First, create an account on [UbutuOne](https://login.ubuntu.com/). Then go to [LivePatch](https://ubuntu.com/livepatch)  to get your token.

The first two lines copied from the LivePatch site install the patch. The next line shows the status of my system with the kernel automatially patched.
