# Overview

We are not just going to use Linux in the cloud. To become more familiar with Linux, we are going to run Linux locally. Termux is an Android app which can be installed on your phone like any other app and WSL can be installed on Windows 10. Both give you a Linux environment to connect to our cloud server and to learn and practise basic commands. There are four ways here to have a Linux environment. Termux should be all you need to access and amonitor your cloud server.
