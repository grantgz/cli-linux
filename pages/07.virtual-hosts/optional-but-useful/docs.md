 <p>With a virtual host setup, you can have several different domains running on the same server. For example I could have</p>
*vdsmoodle.xyz
*vdsblog.xyz
*vdstes.xyz
<p>All have ther own directory under /var/www/html and are running on our single server .Each request coming to the server is sent to one directory. </p>
