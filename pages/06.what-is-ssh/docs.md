SSH is a secure shell which allows you to connect to the command line of your remote server. It opens in a terminal window. The remote machine must be running OpenSSH and accepting connections.

There are different ways of running SSH depending  on your setup. SSH runs on any Linux distribution and can also be run from the Windows command prompt. SSH can also be run from an Android phone using Termux. It is best to have at least two ways of accessing your remote server with SSH.

This chapter will cover setting up the Linux emulators Termux and WSL, connections and security.
