    <p>To install new programs we use a package manager called apt</p>
<p style="font-family:Courier; color:white; background-color:black;">

apt update
</p>

<p>This command will check all the programs on your system and mark any that need upgrading. It should be run before installing any new packages. </p>

<p style="font-family:Courier; color:white; background-color:black;">
apt upgrade
</p>

<p>This will give a list of the packages to be upgraded. Generally safe to enter Y for Yes. Once that is done your system is up to date</p>
<p>To install a new program:<br>
    <p style="font-family:Courier; color:white; background-color:black;">
 apt install nano
</p></p>

<p> nano is a text editor which is easier to use than some other Linux editors. Add text and use the arrow keys to navigate within the page. To save, select CTRL and then the letter 0 to write out. You can also use CTRL X. This will ask if you wish to save
    the modified buffer, then confirms the file name.</p>
