<p>    
    <b>ssh</b> is a quick way to log on and access the file system of your server. From the bash shell on <a href="https://vdsbasic.xyz/install-lamp-on-windows-10/">WSL</a>, I would use this command.</p>

<p style="font-family:Courier; color:white; background-color:black;">

$ ssh  jimmy@vdsbasic.xyz

</p>

<p>The remote server will prompt you for the password. You can skip the password step by installing key-based SSH. ( Note:you will still be able to log on using a password on devices without a key pair).</p>


<p style="font-family:Courier; color:white; background-color:black;">


jimmy@WSLBASH:~$ ssh-keygen -t rsa<br>
Generating public/private rsa key pair.<br>
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/jimmy/.ssh/id_rsa):<br>
  

</p>
<p>
Enter - accept as default</p>

<p style="font-family:Courier; color:white; background-color:black;">

Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):<br>
Enter same passphrase again:<br>

</p>

<p>Enter - leave the passphrase as blank</p>


<p style="font-family:Courier; color:white; background-color:black;">

Your identification has been saved in /home/jimmy/.ssh/id_rsa.<br>
Your public key has been saved in /home/jimmy/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.<br>
The key fingerprint is:<br>
SHA256:j....lgOkE jimmy@WSLBASH<br>
The key's randomart image is:<br>
+---[RSA 2048]----+<br>
|   .=++..+ oE    |<br>
...................<br>
|              + =|<br>
|               = |<br>
+----[SHA256]-----+<br>
jimmy@WSLBASH:~$<br>

</p>

<p>Your output should look something like this.</p>

<p>Now you have a private and public key saved in ~/.ssh/
Copy the public key to your server.</p>


<p style="font-family:Courier; color:white; background-color:black;">
$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub jimmy@vdsbasic.xyz<br>
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/home/grantm/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"<br>
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed<br>
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys<br>
Please login as the user "ubuntu" rather than the user "root".<br>
jimmy@vdsbasic.xyz's password: <br>
<br>
Number of key(s) added: 1<br>

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'jimmy@vdsbasic.xyz'"<br>
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.<br>

</p>

<p>
Now you should be able to log in using ssh without having to enter a password. No password means you can start using other useful bash commands such as scp and rsync.</p>


<p>You can simplify ssh login by creating a configuration file, Remember to change host and hostname in ypur example.</p>

<p style="font-family:Courier; color:white; background-color:black;">
sudo nano ~/.ssh/config
</p>
<p>
Enter these commands for user jimmy</p>


<p style="font-family:Courier; color:white; background-color:black;">
Host vds<br>
HostName vdsbasic.xyz<br>
Port 22<br>
User jimmy<br>
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa<br>
TCPKeepAlive no <br>
ClientAliveInterval 30<br>
ClientAliveCountMax 240<br>
</p>
<p>You can now ssh into your serve</p>
r with

<p style="font-family:Courier; color:white; background-color:black;">ssh vds</p>


<p>Once you have this setup you can harden ssh by removing root login and  preventing ssh login by password. This makes a ssh brute force attack much more difficult.</p>
