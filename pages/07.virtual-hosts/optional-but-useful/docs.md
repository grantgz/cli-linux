 <p>With a virtual domain setup, you can have several different domains running on the same server. For example I could have</p>
 
    <ul>
    <li>vdsmoodle.xyz</li>
      <li>vdsblog.xyz</li>
      <li>vdstes.xyz</li>
    </ul>
<p>All have ther own directory under /var/www/html and are running on one .Each request coming to the server is sent to one directory. </p>
