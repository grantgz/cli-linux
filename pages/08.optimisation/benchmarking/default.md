title: Benchmarking
---

This used a Moodle plugin called Moodle Benchmarking to give an indicatioon of weaknesses in your system.
Dashboard -> Site administration -> Plugins -> Install plugins
Installing failed because of being unable to write to /var/www/html/moodle/report so this is fixed by a temporary change to permissions. Mine is set up to drwxr-xr-x which is 755 meaning the directory is unable to be written to
sudo chmod 777 /var/www/html/moodle/report
Then run the benchnark plugin again and
sudo chmod 755 /var/www/html/moodle/report
After a few checks, upgrade your database.
