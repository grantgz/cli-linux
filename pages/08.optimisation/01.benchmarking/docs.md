<p>This used a Moodle plugin called Moodle Benchmarking to give an indicatioon of weaknesses in your system.
</p>
<p>
    Dashboard -> Site administration -> Plugins -> Install plugins
</p>
    <p>Installing failed because of being unable to write to /var/www/html/moodle/report so this is fixed by a temporary change to permissions. Mine is set up to drwxr-xr-x which is 755 meaning the directory is unable to be written to. </p>
<code> 
sudo chmod 777 /var/www/html/moodle/report<br>
</code> 
Then run the benchmark plugin again and reset permissions:<br>
<code> sudo chmod 755 /var/www/html/moodle/report<br></code> 
After a few checks, upgrade your database.
Dashboard -> Site administration -> Reports -> Benchmark
