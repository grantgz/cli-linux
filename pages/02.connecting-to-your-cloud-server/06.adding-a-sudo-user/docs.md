<p>We are adding a new user called jimmy. Our new server has already given us a sudo user but some Linux distributions may log you in as root. This command assumes you have logged in as ubuntu, a sudo user. <br></p>
<div style="background-color:black;color:white;padding:20px;">
    sudo adduser jimmy

    <p>Set password prompts:<br> Enter new UNIX password:<br> Retype new UNIX password:<br> passwd: password updated successfully<br></p>
</div>
<p>
    Password is entered twice. Make sure it is strong. The other details can be folled in or skiped.</p>
<p></p>
<div style="background-color:black;color:white;padding:20px;">

    User information prompts:<br> Changing the user information for username<br> Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default<br> Full Name []:<br> Room Number []:<br> Work Phone []:<br> Home Phone []:<br> Other []:<br> Is the information correct?
    [Y/n] Y<br>
    <p></p>
</div>

Run the cooamnd **sudo usermod -aG sudo jimmy**
<div style="background-color:black;color:white;padding:20px;">
ubuntu@vds2:~$ sudo usermod -aG sudo jimmy <br>
ubuntu@vds2:~$ su jimmy<br>
Password: <br>
To run a command as administrator (user "root"), use "sudo <command>".<br>
See "man sudo_root" for details.<br>

jimmy@vds2:/home/ubuntu$ <br>
</div>
<p>The command **su jimmy** sets the user to jimmy. Notice how the prompt changes. From now on we will log in as jimmy and use sudo to run  commands as administrator.</p>


<p>In Ubuntu the logging on as root is strongly discouraged. We are creating a new user (jimmy). The user ubuntu is not root so we add sudo before the command, The user jimmy is then given sudo privileges. <br></p>
<p><b>From now on, never log in as root. Always use your new user and sudo to carry out any admin procedures.</b></p>
