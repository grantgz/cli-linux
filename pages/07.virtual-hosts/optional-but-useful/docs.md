With a virtual host setup, you can have several different domains running on the same server. For example I could have
* vdsmoodle.xyz
* vdsblog.xyz
* vdstest.xyz

All have ther own directory under /var/www/html and are running on our single server .Each request coming to the server is sent to one directory.
